# Destiny Runner


This package attempts to create a GUI runner for karma. The author doesn't  really like the default console runner and hence attempt to do something better.

Please note that this package will not currently work. This is a very early version (started an hour before publish!) and due to the complexities of peer dependencies needs to be published to be able to verify if it's even working.
